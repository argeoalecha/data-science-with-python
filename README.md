# data-science-with-python
This repo is composed of notebooks presented at the PyCon APAC 2019 in Manila. The motivation is to provide an introduction of   the tools or libraries in Python for data science and machine learning namely, numpy, pandas, matplotlib and scikit learn such that any beginner or intermediate user may be able to follow and focus on the most important resources to progressively improve his/her skills in this discipline. 

Some demo codes are presented to explain the basic concepts and methods behind the tools. As intended and mentioned before, this is very basic and beginner level for now, but as we go along with the learning process, these notebooks shall be expanded and improved to the next levels.
