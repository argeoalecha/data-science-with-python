    "> The term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, in which he programmed a computer to play the game of checkers. The program remembered every position it had already seen, along with the terminal value of the reward function as it improves its capabilities on the game.<br>\n",
    "> Also, Tom M. Mitchell, an American computer scientist, a more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: \"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.\" This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    ">Another generic definitions: \n",
    ">in which a machine can learn by its own without being explicitly programmed\n",
    ">Machine learning is the process of extracting knowledge from data automatically, usually with the goal of making predictions on new, unseen data. A classical example is a spam filter, for which the user keeps labeling incoming mails as either spam or not spam. A machine learning algorithm then \"learns\" a predictive model from data that distinguishes spam from normal emails, a model which can predict for new emails whether they are spam or not.   \n",
    ">Central to machine learning is the concept of **automating decision making** from data **without the user specifying explicit rules** how this decision should be made.\n",
    ">For the case of emails, the user doesn't provide a list of words or characteristics that make an email spam. Instead, the user provides examples of spam and non-spam emails that are labeled as such.\n",
    ">The second central concept is **generalization**. The goal of a machine learning model is to predict on new, previously unseen data. In a real-world application, we are not interested in marking an already labeled email as spam or not. Instead, we want to make the user's life easier by automatically classifying new incoming mail.\n",
